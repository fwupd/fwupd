% fwupd.conf(5) {{PACKAGE_VERSION}} | Configuration File Format

## NAME

**fwupd.conf** â€” configuration file for the fwupd daemon.

## SYNOPSIS

The `{{SYSCONFDIR}}/fwupd/fwupd.conf` file is the main configuration file for the fwupd daemon.
The complete description of the file format and possible parameters are documented here for reference purposes.

## FILE FORMAT

The file consists of a multiple sections with optional parameters. Parameters are of the form:

```text
[section]
key = value
```

The file is line-based, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or
a parameter.

Section and parameter names are case sensitive.

Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.
Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded as is leading and trailing whitespace
in a parameter value.
Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained.

Any line beginning with a hash (`#`) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.

The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed),
unsigned integers, or a boolean, which may be given as **true** or **false**.
Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values.

## DAEMON PARAMETERS

The `[fwupd]` section can contain the following parameters:

**DisabledDevices={{DisabledDevices}}**

  Allow blocking specific devices by their GUID, using semicolons as delimiter.

**DisabledPlugins={{DisabledPlugins}}**

  Allow blocking specific plugins by name.
  Use **fwupdmgr get-plugins** to get the list of plugins.

**ArchiveSizeMax=**

  Maximum archive size that can be loaded in Mb, with 25% of the total system memory as the default.

**IdleTimeout={{IdleTimeout}}**

  Idle time in seconds to shut down the daemon, where a value of **0** specifies "never".

  **NOTE:** some plugins might inhibit the auto-shutdown, for instance thunderbolt.

**IdleInhibitStartupThreshold={{IdleInhibitStartupThreshold}}**

  If the daemon takes more than this time to startup (in milliseconds) then inhibit the idle
  shutdown timer. A value of **0** specifies "never".

**VerboseDomains={{VerboseDomains}}**

  Comma separated list of domains to log in verbose mode.
  If unset, no domains are set to verbose.
  If set to "*", all domains are verbose, which is the same as running the daemon with **--verbose --verbose**.

**UpdateMotd={{UpdateMotd}}**

  Update the message of the day (MOTD) on device and metadata changes.

**EnumerateAllDevices={{EnumerateAllDevices}}**

  For some plugins, enumerate only devices supported by metadata.

**ApprovedFirmware={{ApprovedFirmware}}**

  A list of firmware checksums that has been approved by the site admin
  If unset, all firmware is approved.

**BlockedFirmware={{BlockedFirmware}}**

  Allow blocking specific devices by their cabinet checksum, either SHA-1 or SHA-256.

**UriSchemes={{UriSchemes}}**

  Allowed URI schemes in the preference order; failed downloads from the first scheme will be retried with the next in order until no choices remain.

**IgnorePower={{IgnorePower}}**

  Ignore power levels of devices when running updates.

**OnlyTrusted={{OnlyTrusted}}**

  Only support installing firmware signed with a trusted key.
  Do not set this to `false` on a production or trusted system.

**ShowDevicePrivate={{ShowDevicePrivate}}**

  Show data such as device serial numbers which some users may consider private.

**AllowEmulation={{AllowEmulation}}**

  Allow capturing and loading device emulation by logging all USB transfers.
  Enabling this will greatly increase the amount of memory fwupd uses when upgrading devices.

**TrustedUids={{TrustedUids}}**

  UIDs matching these values that call the D-Bus interface should marked as trusted.

**HostBkc={{HostBkc}}**

  Comma separated list of best known configuration IDs to be used when using `fwupdmgr sync`.
  This can downgrade firmware to factory versions or upgrade firmware to a supported config level. e.g. **vendor-factory-2021q1,mycompany-2023**

**ReleaseDedupe={{ReleaseDedupe}}**

  Deduplicate duplicate releases by the archive checksum are available from more than one source.

**ReleasePriority={{ReleasePriority}}**

  When the same version release is available from more than one source this option can be used to
  either prefer the local version (avoiding a potentially expensive download) or to prefer the
  remote version (which may have updated metadata such as release notes).

  The possible options are `local` or `remote` or empty to not make any adjustment to the policy,
  relying on the `OrderAfter` and `OrderBefore` sections in the remote.

**EspLocation=**

  Set the preferred location used for the EFI system partition (ESP) path.
  This is typically used if UDisks was not able to automatically identify the location for any reason.

**Manufacturer=**

**ProductName=**

**ProductSku=**

**Family=**

**EnclosureKind=**

**BaseboardProduct=**

**BaseboardManufacturer=**

  Override values for SMBIOS or Device Tree data on the local system.
  These are only required when the SMBIOS or Device Tree data is invalid, missing, or to simulate running on another system.
  Empty values should be used to populate blank entries or add values to populate specific entries.

**TrustedReports={{TrustedReports}}**

  Vendor reports matching these expressions will have releases marked as `trusted-report`.
  Each *OR* section is delimited by a `;` and each *AND* section delimited by `&`, e.g.

* `DistroId=chromeos`

  Any report uploaded from ChromeOS is trusted.

* `DistroId=chromeos&RemoteId=lvfs`

  Any report found in the `lvfs` remote uploaded from a ChromeOS machine is trusted.

* `DistroId=fedora&VendorId=19`

  Any report uploaded from Fedora 19 is trusted.

* `DistroId=fedora&VendorId=$OEM`

  Any report uploaded from Fedora by the hardware OEM is trusted.

* `DistroId=fedora;DistroId=rhel&DistroVersion=9`

  Any report uploaded from Fedora (any version) or from RHEL 9 is trusted.

  NOTE: a `VendorId` of `$OEM` represents the OEM vendor ID of the vendor that owns the firmware,
  for example, where Lenovo QA has generated a signed report for a Lenovo laptop.

  There are also three os-release values available, `$ID`, `$VERSION_ID` and `$VARIANT_ID`, which
  allow expressions like:

* `DistroId=$ID`

* `DistroId=$ID,DistroVersion=$VERSION_ID`

* `Flags=is-upgrade,from-oem`

  Any flags listed here must all be matched by the report.

**P2pPolicy={{P2pPolicy}}**

  This tells the daemon what peer-to-peer policy to use. For instance, using Passim, an optional
  local caching service. Using peer-to-peer data might reduce the amount of bandwidth used on your
  network considerably.

  There are three possible values:

* `nothing`: Do not publish any files

* `metadata`: Only publish shared metadata that is common to each machine.

* `firmware`: Only publish firmware archives **after the next reboot** of the machine.

  At some point in the future fwupd will change the default to `metadata,firmware`.

**TestDevices={{TestDevices}}**

  Create virtual test devices and remote for validating daemon flows.
  This is only intended for CI testing and development purposes.

{% if plugin_uefi_capsule %}

## UEFI_CAPSULE PARAMETERS

The `[uefi_capsule]` section can contain the following parameters:

**EnableGrubChainLoad={{uefi_capsule_EnableGrubChainLoad}}**

  Configure GRUB to launch `fwupdx64.efi` instead of using other methods such as NVRAM or Capsule-On-Disk.

**DisableShimForSecureBoot={{uefi_capsule_DisableShimForSecureBoot}}**

  The shim loader is required to chainload the fwupd EFI binary unless the `fwupd.efi` file has been self-signed manually.

**RequireESPFreeSpace={{uefi_capsule_RequireESPFreeSpace}}**

  Amount of free space required on the ESP, for example using `32` for 32Mb.
  By default this is dynamically set to at least twice the size of the payload.

**DisableCapsuleUpdateOnDisk={{uefi_capsule_DisableCapsuleUpdateOnDisk}}**

  Allow ignoring the CapsuleOnDisk support advertised by the firmware.

**EnableEfiDebugging={{uefi_capsule_EnableEfiDebugging}}**

  Enable the low-level debugging of `fwupdx64.efi` to the `FWUPDATE_DEBUG_LOG` EFI variable.

  **NOTE:** enabling this option is going to fill up the NVRAM store much more quickly and
  should only be enabled when debugging an issue with the EFI binary.

  This value also has no affect when using Capsule-on-Disk as the EFI helper binary is
  not being used.

**RebootCleanup={{uefi_capsule_RebootCleanup}}**

  Delete any capsule files copy to the ESP, and remove any EFI variables set for the update.

  **NOTE:** disabling this option is only required when debugging the flash process and normal
  users should not need to change this setting.
{% endif %}

{% if plugin_msr %}

## MSR PARAMETERS

The `[msr]` section can contain the following parameter:

**MinimumSmeKernelVersion={{msr_MinimumSmeKernelVersion}}**

  Minimum kernel version to allow probing for sme flag.

  This only needs to be modified by enterprise kernels that have cherry picked the feature into a
  kernel with an old version number.
{% endif %}

{% if plugin_redfish %}

## REDFISH PARAMETERS

The `[redfish]` section can contain the following parameters:

**Uri={{redfish_Uri}}**

  The URI to the Redfish service in the format `scheme://ip:port` for instance `https://192.168.0.133:443`

  BMCs using self-signed certificates will not work unless the plugin does not verify it against the system CAs.

**IpmiDisableCreateUser={{redfish_IpmiDisableCreateUser}}**

  Do not use IPMI KCS to create an initial user account if no SMBIOS data.
  Setting this to **true** prevents creating user accounts on the BMC automatically.

**ManagerResetTimeout={{redfish_ManagerResetTimeout}}**

  Amount of time in seconds to wait for a BMC restart.
{% endif %}

## THUNDERBOLT PARAMETERS

The `[thunderbolt]` section can contain the following parameters:

**MinimumKernelVersion={{thunderbolt_MinimumKernelVersion}}**

  Minimum kernel version to allow use of this plugin.

  This only needs to be modified by enterprise kernels that have cherry picked the feature into a
  kernel with an old version number.

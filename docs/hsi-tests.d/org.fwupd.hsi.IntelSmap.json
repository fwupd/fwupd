    "Without Supervisor Mode Access Prevention, the supervisor code usually has full read and write access to user-space memory mappings.",
    "This can make exploits easier to write, as it allows the kernel to access user-space memory when it did not intend to."

    "A local or remote attacker can use a simple exploit to modify the contents of kernel memory which can lead to privilege escalation."

  "description": [
    "Suspend to Ram (S3) keeps the raw contents of the DRAM refreshed when the system is asleep.",
    "This means that the memory modules can be physically removed and the contents recovered, or a cold boot attack can be performed with a USB device.",
    "The firmware should be configured to prefer using suspend to idle instead of suspend to ram or to not offer suspend to RAM."
  ],
  "failure-impact": [
    "An attacker with physical access to a system can obtain the un-encrypted contents of the RAM by suspending the machine, removing the DIMM and inserting it into another machine with modified DRAM controller before the memory contents decay."

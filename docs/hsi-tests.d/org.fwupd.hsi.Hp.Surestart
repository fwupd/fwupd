    "HP SureStart is an advanced self-healing BIOS that automatically recovers the BIOS code if it becomes corrupted or is compromised by malicious software.",
    "When enabled, SureStart monitors the BIOS for unauthorized changes and can automatically restore the BIOS to a known-good state.",
    "This provides runtime intrusion prevention and detection for the firmware, protecting against both malware and physical attacks on the BIOS chip."
  ],
  "failure-impact": [
    "Without HP SureStart enabled, the system firmware is vulnerable to persistent malware that could survive operating system reinstallation.",
    "An attacker who compromises the BIOS could maintain persistent access to the system and potentially bypass security features like Secure Boot.",
    "Physical attacks on the BIOS chip could result in permanent system compromise without detection."

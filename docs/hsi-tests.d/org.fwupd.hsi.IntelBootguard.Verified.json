  "description" : [
    "BootGuard is a processor feature that prevents the machine from running firmware images not released by the system manufacturer.",
    "It forms a root-of-trust by fusing in cryptographic keys into the processor itself that are used to verify the Authenticated Code Modules found in the SPI flash."
  ],
  "failure-impact" : [
    "When BootGuard is not set up correctly then the chain-of-trust between the CPU and the bootloader can not be verified.",
    "This would allow subverting the Secure Boot protection which gives the attacker full access to your hardware."

    "Intel hardware provides this mechanism to protect the SPI ROM chip located on the motherboard from being overwritten by the operating system.",

    "The system firmware can be written from userspace.",
    "This gives any attacker with root access a method to write persistent executable code to the firmware, which survives even a full disk wipe and OS reinstall."

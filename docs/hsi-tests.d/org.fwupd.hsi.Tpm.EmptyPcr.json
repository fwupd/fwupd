  "description" : [
    "The system firmware is responsible for measuring values about its boot stage in PCRs 0 through 7.",
    "Some firmwares have bugs that prevent them from measuring some of those values, breaking the fundamental assumption of the Measured Boot chain-of-trust."
  ],
  "failure-impact" : [
    "A local attacker could measure fake values into the empty PCR, corresponding to a firmware and OS that do not match the ones actually loaded.",
    "This allows hiding a compromised boot chain or fooling a remote-attestation server into believing that a different kernel is running."

  "description": [
    "The system firmware is responsible for measuring values about its boot stage in PCRs 0 through 7.",
    "Some firmwares have bugs that prevent them from measuring some of those values, breaking the fundamental assumption of the Measured Boot chain-of-trust."
  ],
  "failure-impact": [
    "A local attacker could measure fake values into the empty PCR, corresponding to a firmware and OS that do not match the ones actually loaded.",
    "This allows hiding a compromised boot chain or fooling a remote-attestation server into believing that a different kernel is running."

  "failure-results": {
    "not-found": "no TPM hardware could be found",

  "success-results": {
    "valid": "all PCRs from 0 to 7 must have non-empty measurements"

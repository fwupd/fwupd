  "description": [
    "Some devices support a concept of whether a part has been unlocked for debugging using proprietary hardware. Such parts allow access to registers that are typically restricted when parts are fused.",
    "On Intel systems access to this interface is done via a proprietary Direct Connection Interface (DCI)."
  ],
  "failure-impact": [
    "If using a debug unlocked part, the platform's overall security will be decreased as an attacker may have elevated access to registers and memory within the system and can potentially enable persistent backdoors."

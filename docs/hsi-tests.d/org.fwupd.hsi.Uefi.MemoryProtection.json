  "description": [
    "The UEFI system can set up memory attributes at boot which prevent common exploits from running. For instance, the stack can be marked as non-executable to prevent running any malicious code that can be written to the stack.",
    "In the same way, writing to sections that are read-only can also be prevented, making the system more secure from attackers.",
    "Distribution vendors should tag the bootloader as NX compatible, and BIOS vendors should provide a 'memory attribute protocol' table that tags memory sections with specific properties.",
    "Microsoft Virtualization-based security (VBS) also requires NX protection for UEFI runtime services for DeviceGuard compliance."
  ],
  "failure-impact": [
    "The attacker is able to run arbitrary executable code from the stack, or write to memory that is supposed to be read-only."

  "failure-results": {
    "not-locked": "memory is still executable or writable",

Distribution packages
=====================
The relevant packaging necessary to generate *RPM*, *DEB* and *PKG* distribution packages is contained here.
It is used regularly for continuous integration using [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org). The generated packages can be used on a distribution such as Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu or Arch Linux.

The build can be performed using Linux containers with [Docker](www.docker.com).

## RPM packages
A Dockerfile for Fedora can be generated in `contrib`.

To prepare the Docker container run this command:

```
OS=fedora ./generate_docker.py
```

To build the RPMs run this command (from the root of your git checkout):

```
docker run -t -v `pwd`:/build fwupd-fedora
```

RPMs will be made available in your working directory when complete.

## DEB packages
A Dockerfile for Debian or Ubuntu can be generated in `contrib`.

To prepare the Docker container run one of these commands:

```
OS=debian-x86_64 ./generate_docker.py
OS=debian-i386 ./generate_docker.py
OS=ubuntu ./generate_docker.py
```


To build the DEBs run one of these commands (from the root of your git checkout):

```
docker run -t -v `pwd`:/build fwupd-debian-x86_64
docker run -t -v `pwd`:/build fwupd-debian-i386
docker run -t -v `pwd`:/build fwupd-ubuntu
```

DEBs will be made available in your working directory when complete.

## PKG packages
A Dockerfile for Arch can be generated in `contrib`.

To prepare the Docker container run this command:

```OS=arch ./generate_docker.py

To build the PKGs run this command (from the root of your git checkout):

```docker run -t -v `pwd`:/build fwupd-arch```

PKGs will be made available in your working directory when complete.

## Additional packages
Submissions for generating additional packages for other distribution mechanisms are also welcome.  
All builds should occur in Docker containers.

Please feel free to submit the following:
* Dockerfile for the container for your distro
* Relevant technical packaging scripts (such as ebuilds, spec file etc)
* A shell script that can be launched in the container to generate distribution packages

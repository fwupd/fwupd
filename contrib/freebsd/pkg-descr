Make firmware updates automatic, safe, and reliable.

fwupd is a simple daemon to allow session software to update device firmware on
your local machine.  It is designed for desktops, but also usable on phones and
headless servers.  You can either use a GUI software manager like GNOME Software
to view and apply updates, the command-line tool, or the system D-Bus interface
directly.

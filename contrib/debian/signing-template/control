Description: Tools to manage UEFI firmware updates (signed)
 fwupd provides functionality to update system firmware. It has been
 initially designed to update firmware using UEFI capsule updates, but
 it is designed to be extensible to other firmware update standards.
 .
 This package contains just the signed version of the fwupd binary,
 needed if your system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled. It depends on the
 normal fwupd package for everything else.

NVMe
====

Introduction
------------

This plugin adds support for NVMe storage hardware. Devices are enumerated from
the Identify Controller data structure and can be updated with appropriate
firmware file. Firmware is sent in 4kB chunks and activated on next reboot.

The device GUID is read from the vendor specific area and if not found then
generated from the trimmed model string.

Firmware Format
---------------

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
an unspecified binary file format.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

 * org.nvmexpress

GUID Generation
---------------

These device use the NVMe DeviceInstanceId values, e.g.

 * `NVME\VEN_1179&DEV_010F&REV_01`
 * `NVME\VEN_1179&DEV_010F`
 * `NVME\VEN_1179`

The FRU globally unique identifier (FGUID) is also added from the CNS if set.
Please refer to this document for more details on how to add support for FGUID:
https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM_Express_Revision_1.3.pdf

Additionally, for NVMe drives with Dell vendor firmware two extra GUIDs are
added:

 * `STORAGE-DELL-${component-id}`

and any optional GUID saved in the vendor extension block.

Update Behavior
---------------

The firmware is deployed when the device is in normal runtime mode, but it is
only activated when the system is either restarted or in some cases shutdown.

Quirk use
---------
This plugin uses the following plugin-specific quirks:

| Quirk                  | Description                                 | Minimum fwupd version |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `NvmeBlockSize`        | The block size used for NVMe writes         | 1.1.3                 |
| `Flags`                | `force-align` if image should be padded     | 1.2.4                 |

Vendor ID Security
------------------

The vendor ID is set from the udev vendor, for example set to `NVME:0x1179`

External interface access
-------------------------
This plugin requires ioctl `NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD` access.

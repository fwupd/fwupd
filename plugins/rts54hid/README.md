Realtek RTS54HID HID Support
=========================

Introduction
------------

This plugin allows the user to update any supported hub and attached downstream
ICs using a custom HID-based flashing protocol. It does not support any RTS54xx
device using the HUB update protocol.

Other devices connected to the RTS54HIDxx using I2C will be supported soon.

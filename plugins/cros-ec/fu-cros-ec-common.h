 * just as to any other block of the transfer sequence.
 *
 * It became clear that there is a need to be able to enhance the update
 * protocol, while staying backwards compatible.
 *
 * All newer protocol versions (starting with version 2) respond to the very
 * first packet with an 8 byte or larger response, where the first 4 bytes are
 * a version specific data, and the second 4 bytes - the protocol version
 * number.
 *
 * This way the host receiving of a four byte value in response to the first
 * packet is considered an indication of the target running the 'legacy'
 * protocol, version 1. Receiving of an 8 byte or longer response would
 * communicates the protocol version in the second 4 bytes.

## Introduction

This plugin is used to update Power Delivery devices by Fresco.

## Firmware Format

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
an unspecified binary format.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

* `com.frescologic.pd`

## GUID Generation

These devices use the standard USB DeviceInstanceId values, e.g.

* `USB\VID_1D5C&PID_7102&REV_0001`
* `USB\VID_1D5C&PID_7102`
* `USB\VID_1D5C`

These devices also use custom GUID values, e.g.

* `USB\VID_1D5C&PID_7102&CID_01`

## Update Behavior

The firmware is deployed when the device is in normal runtime mode, and the
device will reset when the new firmware has been written.

## Vendor ID Security

The vendor ID is set from the USB vendor, in this instance set to `USB:0x1D5C`

## External Interface Access

This plugin requires read/write access to `/dev/bus/usb`.

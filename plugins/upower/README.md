UPower Support
==============

Introduction
------------

This plugin is used to ensure that some updates are not done on battery power.

Vendor ID Security
------------------

This protocol does not create a device and thus requires no vendor ID set.

External interface access
-------------------------
This plugin requires access to the dbus interface `org.freedesktop.UPower`.

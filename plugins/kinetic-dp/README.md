# Kinetic DP

This plugin supports updating FW for Kinetic DP converter chips.

## Firmware Format

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
an unspecified binary file format.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

* com.kinet-ic.dp

## GUID Generation

These devices use custom GUID values, e.g.

* `KT-DP-$(chip_family)-$(chip-ID)`
* `KT-DP-$(chip_family)`

Please refer to the plugin source for more details about how the GUID is
constructed for specific hardware.

## Vendor ID Security

The vendor ID is set from the PCI vendor, for example set to `DRM_DP_AUX_DEV:0x$(vid)`

## Requirements

### (Kernel) DP Aux Interface

Kernel 4.6 introduced an DRM DP Aux interface for manipulation of the registers
needed to access an DP hub.
This patch can be backported to earlier kernels:

## Usage

Supported devices will be displayed in `# fwupdmgr get-devices` output.

## Supported devices

## External interface access

This plugin requires read/write access to `/dev/drm_dp_aux*`.

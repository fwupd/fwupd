# UEFI Capsule

## Introduction

The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that
defines the software interface between an OS and platform firmware.
With the UpdateCapsule boot service it can be used to update system firmware.

If you don't want or need this functionality you can use the
`-Dplugin_uefi_capsule=false` option.

When this plugin is enabled, the companion UEFI binary may also be built from the [fwupd-efi](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd-efi) project if not already present on the filesystem.
This behavior can be overridden using the meson option `-Defi_binary=false`.

For this companion binary to work with secure boot, it will need to be signed by an authority trusted with shim and/or the host environment.

## Lenovo Specific Behavior

On Lenovo hardware only the boot label is set to `Linux-Firmware-Updater` rather
than "Linux Firmware Updater" (with spaces) due to long-fixed EFI boot manager
bugs. Many users will have these old BIOS versions installed and so we use the
`use-legacy-bootmgr-desc` quirk to use the safe name.

On some Lenovo hardware only one capsule is installable due to possible problems
with the UpdateCapsule coalesce operation. As soon as one UEFI device has been
scheduled for update the other UEFI devices found in the ESRT will be marked
as `updatable-hidden` rather than `updatable`. Rebooting will restore them so
they can be updated on next OS boot.

## Firmware Format

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
EFI capsule file format.

See the [UEFI specification](https://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20Spec%202_6.pdf)
for details.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

* org.uefi.capsule

## Update Behavior

### Capsule update on-disk

Described in  [UEFI specification](https://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20Spec%202_6.pdf)
ยง 8.5.5 - Delivery of Capsules via file on Mass Storage device.

If the firmware supports this, it will be the preferred method of updating on
aarch64 platforms. You can explicitly disable it by by modifying
*DisableCapsuleUpdateOnDisk* in `/etc/fwupd/uefi_capsule.conf`.

Several models with Insyde firmware have been released where `OsIndications`
advertises support for CoD, but it simply *does not work*. For this reasons
the CoD support is only available by opt-in for x86_64 devices, and can be
specified using the `uefi-allow-cod` plugin flag for the appropriate HwID.

The spec expects runtime *SetVariable* to be available in order to enable this
feature, we need to set `EFI_OS_INDICATIONS_FILE_CAPSULE_DELIVERY_SUPPORTED`
in *OsIndications* variable to trigger processing of submitted capsule on next
reboot. However some firmware implementations (e.g U-Boot), can't set the
variable at runtime, but ignore the variable in next reboot and apply the
capsule anyway.

The directory \EFI\UpdateCapsule is checked for capsules only within the EFI
system partition on the device specified in the active boot option determine by
reference to *BootNext* variable or *BootOrder* variable processing.  Since
setting *BootNext*, for capsule update on-disk, is not yet implemented, the only
available option is place the \EFI\UpdateCapsule within the ESP partition
indicated by the current *BootOrder*.
Note that this will be always needed if your firmware doesn't support
*SetVariable* at runtime (even if *BootNext* functionality is added).

### Runtime capsule updates

The firmware is deployed when the OS is running, but it is only written when the
system has been restarted and the `fwupd*.efi` binary has been run. To achieve
this fwupd sets up the EFI `BootNext` variable, creating the new boot entry if
required.

## GUID Generation

These devices use the UEFI GUID as provided in the ESRT. Additionally, for the
system device the `main-system-firmware` GUID is also added.

For compatibility with Windows 10, the plugin also adds GUIDs of the form
`UEFI\RES_{$(esrt)}`.

## Vendor ID Security

The vendor ID is set from the BIOS vendor, for example `DMI:LENOVO` for all
devices that are not marked as supporting Firmware Management Protocol. For FMP
device no vendor ID is set.

## UEFI Unlock Support

On some Dell systems it is possible to turn on and off UEFI capsule
support from within the BIOS.  This functionality can also be adjusted
from within the OS by fwupd. This requires compiling with libsmbios support.

When fwupd has been compiled with this support you will be able to enable UEFI
support on the device by using the `unlock` command.

## Custom EFI System Partition (ESP)

Since version 1.1.0 fwupd will autodetect the ESP if it is mounted on
`/boot/efi`, `/boot`, or `/efi`, and UDisks is available on the system. In
other cases the mount point of the ESP needs to be manually specified using the
option *OverrideESPMountPoint* in `/etc/fwupd/uefi_capsule.conf`.

Setting an invalid directory will disable the fwupd plugin.

## External Interface Access

This plugin requires:

* read/write access to the EFI system partition.
* read access to `/sys/firmware/efi/esrt/`
* read access to `/sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size`
* read/write access to `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars`

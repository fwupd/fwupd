ColorHug Support
================

Introduction
------------

The ColorHug is an affordable open source display colorimeter built by
Hughski Limited. The USB device allows you to calibrate your screen for
accurate color matching.

ColorHug versions 1 and 2 support a custom HID-based flashing protocol, but
version 3 (ColorHug+) has now switched to DFU.

title: Plugin: Redfish
---

## Introduction

Redfish is an open industry standard specification and schema that helps enable
simple and secure management of modern scalable platform hardware.

By specifying a RESTful interface and utilizing JSON and OData, Redfish helps
customers integrate solutions within their existing tool chains.

## Firmware Format

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
an unspecified binary file format.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

* `org.dmtf.redfish`

## GUID Generation

These devices use the provided GUID provided in the `SoftwareId` property
without modification if it is a valid GUID. If the property is not a GUID then
the vendor instance ID is used instead:

* `REDFISH\\VENDOR_${RedfishManufacturer}&SOFTWAREID_${RedfishSoftwareId}`

Additionally, this Instance ID is added for quirk and parent matching:

* `REDFISH\VENDOR_${RedfishManufacturer}&ID_${RedfishId}`

## Update Behavior

The firmware will be deployed as appropriate. The Redfish API does not specify
when the firmware will actually be written to the SPI device.

## Vendor ID Security

No vendor ID is set as there is no vendor field in the schema.

## Quirk Use

This plugin uses the following plugin-specific quirks:

### RedfishResetPreDelay

Delay in ms to use before querying the manager after a cleanup reset, default 0ms.

Since: 1.8.0

### RedfishResetPostDelay

Delay in ms to use before querying /redfish/v1/UpdateService after a cleanup reset,
default 0ms.

Since: 1.8.0

## Setting Service IP Manually

The service IP may not be automatically discoverable due to the absence of
Type 42 entry in SMBIOS. In this case, you have to specify the service IP
to RedfishUri in /etc/fwupd/redfish.conf

Take HPE Gen10 for example, the service IP can be found with the following
command:

```shell
ilorest --nologo list --selector=EthernetInterface. -j
```

This command lists all network interfaces, and the Redfish service IP belongs
to one of "Manager Network" Interfaces. For example:

```json
    {
      "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#EthernetInterface.EthernetInterface",
      "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Managers/1/EthernetInterfaces/1/",
      "@odata.type": "#EthernetInterface.v1_0_3.EthernetInterface",
      "Description": "Configuration of this Manager Network Interface",
      "HostName": "myredfish",
      "IPv4Addresses": [
        {
          "SubnetMask": "255.255.255.0",
          "AddressOrigin": "DHCP",
          "Gateway": "192.168.0.1",
          "Address": "192.168.0.133"
        }
      ],
      ...
```

In this example, the service IP is "192.168.0.133".

Since the conventional HTTP port is 80 and HTTPS port is 443, we can set
RedfishUri to either "http://192.168.0.133:80" or "https://192.168.0.133:443"
and verify the uri with

```shell
curl http://192.168.0.133:80/redfish/v1/
```

or

```shell
curl -k https://192.168.0.133:443/redfish/v1/
```

## External Interface Access

This requires HTTP access to a given URL.

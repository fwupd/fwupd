# Jabra GNP

## Introduction

This plugin is used to firmware update for some Jabra devices
(refer to the `jabra-gnp.quirk` file for more information).
Notably this excludes devices supported by the `jabra` plugin,
as well as 1st edition Jabra Evolve (non-SE) devices and the
corresponding Jabra Link connectors.

## GUID Generation

These devices use the standard USB DeviceInstanceId values, e.g.

* `USB\VID_0B0E&PID_24DB`

## Update Behavior

The device is updated at runtime using USB control and interrupt transfers.

## Vendor ID Security

The vendor ID is set from the USB vendor, in this instance set to `USB:0x0B0E`

### JabraGnpAddress

Since: 1.9.20

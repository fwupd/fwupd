title: Plugin: Wacom RAW
---

## Introduction

This plugin updates integrated Wacom AES and EMR devices. They are typically
connected using IÂ²C and not USB.

## GUID Generation

The HID DeviceInstanceId values are used, e.g. `HIDRAW\VEN_056A&DEV_4875`.

## Firmware Format

The daemon will decompress the cabinet archive and extract a firmware blob in
Intel HEX file format.

This plugin supports the following protocol ID:

* `com.wacom.raw`

## Quirk Use

This plugin uses the following plugin-specific quirks:

### WacomI2cFlashBlockSize

Block size to transfer firmware.

Since: 1.2.4

### WacomI2cFlashBaseAddr

Base address for firmware.

Since: 1.2.4

### WacomI2cFlashSize

Maximum size of the firmware zone.

Since: 1.2.4

## Update Behavior

The device usually presents in runtime mode, but on detach re-enumerates with a
different HIDRAW PID in a bootloader mode. On attach the device re-enumerates
back to the runtime mode.

For this reason the `REPLUG_MATCH_GUID` internal device flag is used so that
the bootloader and runtime modes are treated as the same device.

## Vendor ID Security

The vendor ID is set from the udev vendor, in this instance set to `HIDRAW:0x056A`

## External Interface Access

This plugin requires ioctl `HIDIOCSFEATURE` access.

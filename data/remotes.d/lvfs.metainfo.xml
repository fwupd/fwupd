          The LVFS is a free service that operates as an independent legal
          entity and has no connection with $OS_RELEASE:NAME$.
          Your distributor may not have verified any of the firmware updates for
          compatibility with your system or connected devices.
          All firmware is provided only by the original equipment manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enabling this functionality is done at your own risk, which means you
          have to contact your original equipment manufacturer regarding any
          problems caused by these updates.
          Only problems with the update process itself should be filed at
          $OS_RELEASE:BUG_REPORT_URL$.

Version 0.1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-09-10

New Features:
 - Remove fwsignd, we have the LVFS now (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Add application metadata when getting the updates list (Richard Hughes)
 - Depend on appstream-glib >= 0.5.0 (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't apply firmware if something else is processing the update (Richard Hughes)
 - Install fwupd into /usr/lib/$(triplet)/fwupd instead (Mario Limonciello)
 - Simplify the version properties on devices to avoid complexity (Richard Hughes)
 - Update the offline update service to invoke right command (Kalev Lember)
 - Use the new secure metadata URI (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-08-12

Notes:
 - For the device verification code to work correctly you need at least
   libappstream-glib 0.5.0 installed.

New Features:
 - Add a Raspberry Pi firmware provider (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple config file to store the correct LVFS download URI (Richard Hughes)
 - Make parsing the option ROM runtime optional (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Allow fwupd to be autostarted by systemd (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow no arguments to 'fwupdmgr verify-update' and use sane defaults (Richard Hughes)
 - Devices with option ROM are always internal (Richard Hughes)
 - Do not pre-convert the update description from AppStream XML (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix validation of written firmware (Richard Hughes)
 - Move the verification and metadata matching phase to the daemon (Richard Hughes)
 - Sign the test binary with the correct key (Richard Hughes)
 - Use the AppStream 0.9 firmware specification by default (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-07-25

Notes:
 - In this release we've moved the LVFS website to the fwupd project and made
   them work really well together. To update all the firmware on your system
   is now just a case of "fwupdmgr refresh && fwupdmgr update"
 - We've also added verification of BIOS and PCI ROM firmware, which may be
   useful for forensics or to verify that system updates have been applied.

New Features:
 - Actually parse the complete PCI option ROM (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a 'fwupdmgr update' command to update all devices to latest versions (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple signing server that operates on .cab files (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a 'verify' command that verifies the cryptographic hash of device firmware (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow clients to add new firmware metadata to the system cache (Richard Hughes)
 - Move GetUpdates to the daemon (Richard Hughes)
 - Move the LVFS website to the fwupd project (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Accept multiple files at one time when using fwupdmgr dump-rom (Richard Hughes)
 - Automatically download metadata using fwupdmgr if required (Richard Hughes)
 - Do not return NULL as a gboolean (Thomas Hindoe Paaboel Andersen)
 - Don't call efibootmgr after fwupdate (Mario Limonciello)
 - Fallback to offline install when calling the update argument (Mario Limonciello)
 - Fix Intel VBIOS detection on Dell hardware (Richard Hughes)
 - Reload appstream data after refreshing (Mario Limonciello)
 - Use the new LVFS GPG key (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix build: libgusb is required even without colorhug support (Jussi Kukkonen)

Version 0.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-05-28

New Features:
 - Get the firmware version from the device descriptors (Richard Hughes)
 - Run the offline actions using systemd when required (Richard Hughes)
 - Support OpenHardware devices using the fwupd vendor extensions (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Add an UNKNOWN status so we can return meaningful enum values (Richard Hughes)
 - Coldplug the devices before acquiring the well known name (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-04-22
 - Add some guidelines for vendors to README (Richard Hughes)
 - Only allow signed firmware to be upgraded without a password (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-03-23

New Features:
 - Add a 'get-updates' command to fwupdmgr (Richard Hughes)
 - Add and document the offline-update lifecycle (Richard Hughes)
 - Create a libfwupd shared library (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Create runtime directories if they do not exist (Richard Hughes)
 - Do not crash when there are no devices to return (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-03-16

Notes:
 - fwupd is a simple daemon to allow session software to update firmware.

Getting started
===============
To set up your local environment, from the top level of the checkout run
```
./contrib/setup
```

This will create pre-commit hooks to fixup many code style issues before your
code is submitted.

On some Linux distributions this will install all build dependencies needed
to compile fwupd as well.

Coding Style
============

The coding style to respect in this project is very similar to most
GLib projects. In particular, the following rules are largely adapted
from the PackageKit Coding Style.

 * 8-space tabs for indentation

 * Prefer lines of less than <= 80 columns

 * 1-space between function name and braces (both calls and macro
   declarations)

 * If function signature/call fits in a single line, do not break it
   into multiple lines

 * Prefer descriptive names over abbreviations (unless well-known)
   and shortening of names. e.g `device` not `dev`

 * Single statements inside if/else should not be enclosed by '{}'

 * Use comments to explain why something is being done, but also avoid
   over-documenting the obvious. Here is an example of useless comment:

   // Fetch the document
   fetch_the_document ();

 * Comments should not start with a capital letter or end with a full stop and
   should be C-style, not C++-style, e.g. `/* this */` not `// this`

 * Each object should go in a separate .c file and be named according
   to the class

 * Use g_autoptr() and g_autofree whenever possible, and avoid `goto out`
   error handling

 * Failing methods should return FALSE with a suitable `GError` set

 * Trailing whitespace is forbidden

 * Pointers should be checked for NULL explicitly, e.g. `foo != NULL` not `!foo`
